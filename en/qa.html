            of the original GTA?</h4>
          <p><span class="TXT-RED">Answer: </span></p>
          <p class="MG-B15">In general, modifications include various meanings of various degrees. Here, I will explain
            the most basic idea of why we designate it as a modified &ldquo;version&rdquo;, rather than explaining from
            a technical viewpoint. In other words, I will explain the overall characteristics of the M-GTA as a
            qualitative research method.</p>
          <p class="MG-B15">The following is a text that I wrote for a flyer for the M-GTA Book Series published by
            Koubundou. I put this together in a short time; however, as I reread it, I found it quite useful for
            understanding the overall characteristics of the M-GTA. So I quote the text.</p>
          <blockquote class="MG-B15">
            <p>The Grounded Theory Approach (GTA) was proposed in the 1960s as a qualitative study approach to enable
              the generation of unique theories through coherent analysis grounded on data. Since then, the GTA was
              applied widely in numerous human service fields such as nursing, healthcare, social work, caregiving,
              school education, rehabilitation, and clinical psychology, amongst others. In recent years, amid the
              growing global interest in qualitative study approaches, the GTA has come to hold a position as a classic.
              On the other hand, it underwent its own ups and downs, especially with the dispute between the original
              proposers, Anselm Strauss and Barney Glaser in the early 1990s. It is best now to raise two core questions
              in order to understand the real possibilities of the GTA; "what is the GTA?" and "what is the actual
              process of its analysis?"<br />
              Even if it is a rough gemstone, all the possibilities reside in the original proposal. And then, what we
              have to do is to embody such possibilities concretely in today's situation. Any research stance that
              places importance on the data with the aim of generating a theory, also poses a question about the purpose
              of that theory. Our fundamental recognition is that it is not for the benefit of the researchers, but
              rather that it is necessary as a working hypothesis to support human service practice. Practical
              application of research results is not a secondary purpose, but the primary purpose of the GTA. Given this
              perspective, the possibility of a new mutually stimulating relationship between researcher and
              practitioner emerges.<br />
              The process of polishing this rough gemstone naturally requires that we should overcome limits in the
              original proposal. The GTA was advocated by two sociologists who had contrastive research styles - Barney
              Glaser, whose style had an affinity with quantitative research approaches, and Anselm Strauss, who is
              famous for Symbolic Interactionism and who emphasized the interaction process of meaning generation. In a
              word, one can find in the GTA most of the major issues that should be considered for qualitative studies.
              Thus, any discussion of the GTA is a discussion of qualitative studies in general.<br />
              This series consists of monographs and a presentation of the Modified Grounded Theory Approach (M-GTA) -
              which was made by (1) directly accepting the possibilities of the original GTA, (2) making unique
              modifications in terms of research, theory, epistemology, and technique, and (3) improving it for greater
              practicability. Each of the monographs in this series demonstrates the M-GTA and presents a deep
              understanding of human nature in the different fields. The authors are all researcher-practitioners in
              their respective professional fields, and they have performed the most important characteristic of the
              M-GTA, i.e., the Researcher-At-Work. </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p class="MG-B15">What I want to emphasize here is that even if the original proposal be a rough gemstone, all
            the possibilities reside in it, and what we have to do is to embody such possibilities in today's situation;
            and that the process of polishing a rough gemstone requires that we should overcome their limits. The rough
            gemstone, of course, means the original version of GTA, which is left incomplete. <br />
            In addition to the modifications in terms of the technical aspects for better usability, I also embodied the
            possibilities of the rough gemstone in the M-GTA.</p>
          <p class="MG-B15">Accordingly, the M-GTA succeeds in capturing the essence of the original Glaser-Strauss
            version and proposes its own improvements. It positions itself at a distance from other versions of the GTA:
            the Strauss-Corbin version, the Glaser version, or the recent attempts by Charmaz.</p>
          <p class="MG-B15"> The M-GTA does not use the technique of slicing the data, a technique that is shared among
            all the GTAs mentioned above, including the original version. In this sense, one might insist that the M-GTA
            should not be categorized as a GTA. However, this is only a superficial, external point of view. The M-GTA
            was created through an examination of the possibilities of the original version, which we call the rough
            gemstone, while inheriting and developing many of its principal ideas, and therefore it definitely has its
            origin in the GTA. Also, we call it a modified "version" of the GTA, in deference to the creativity of
            Glaser and Strauss together, not either of them alone. A different designation may avoid confusion, but we
            do not do so for the above-mentioned reason.</p>
          <p class="MG-B15">As was already discussed in my previous books, the slicing of the data is not only a
            technique but it is a methodology, and thus it is inseparable from epistemology. This technique is based on
            simple objectivism. In this connection, Charmaz has inherited it as a technique while introducing the
            epistemology of Social Constructionism, which seems to us to be unstable and at odds internally. </p>
          <p class="MG-B15">Interpretation of the meaning of qualitative data is work performed by a researcher under a
            certain theme with a certain level of awareness of the issues, and it is impossible to look to objectivism
            for an account of its adequacy. Should we then shift our focus to the opposite pole to constructionism, and
            place emphasis on an understanding that includes the nature and process of the collaborative generation of
            meanings, and on sensitivity to the obvious? The M-GTA seeks a unique stance critical of the both of these
            viewpoints. In other words, the issue is how to simultaneously clear both Glaser's consistent
            epistemological standpoint (objectivism) and the other epistemological standpoint (constructionism) that
            essentially constitutes Strauss's stance and is becoming more distinct in recent years. The M-GTA takes the
            position that in qualitative studies, the limits of objectivism cannot be overcome through constructionism.
            In fact, this issue is already recognizable as a structural outline in the rough gemstone (original
            version), and at the same time it also constitutes one of the most important issues when we discuss
            qualitative studies today.</p>
          <p class="MG-B15">Studies based on objectivism aim to generate generalizable knowledge. On the other hand,
            constructionism defines knowledge, at the outset, as something that cannot be generalized, and deals with
            knowledge that is formed in the course of, so to speak, differential-like localization. Although the
            importance of constructionism goes without saying, a difficulty with it is that knowledge becomes closed. In
            contrast with both of these philosophies, the M-GTA intends to generate knowledge (grounded theory) that can
            be generalized within limited scope. This limited generalization requires a combination of the following
            condition settings: (1) a setting where the Researcher-At-Work generates the knowledge through the
            Analytically-Focused Person, and (2) a setting wherein the individuals apply the knowledge in actual
            settings through the viewpoints of the Analytically-Focused Person. This is an important point. Without
            rejecting either objectivism or constructionism, or without leaning too far towards either one - the M-GTA
            thus sets a framework that integrates both sides.</p>
          <p class="MG-B15">Understanding the reason why the M-GTA emphasizes actual practice, particularly practice in
            human service fields, will lead to the clarification of the strategic nature of the M-GTA. On one hand, it
            argues that research as a social activity should be for the practical application of research results with
            the purpose of ameliorating existing problems, while on the other hand, it undertakes the challenge of
            overcoming the acceleration of knowledge polarization, </p>

          <h4><a name="02" id="02"></a><span class="TXT-ORG">Q2:</span> The M-GTA analyses data with a focus on two
            viewpoints: the Analytical Theme, and the Analytically-Focused Person. Given the complexities and abundance
            of detail in qualitative data, what is the rationale and how is data actually analyzed?</h4>
          <p><span class="TXT-RED">Answer: </span></p>
          <p class="MG-B15">Any approaches of qualitative research handle data, records or materials using one method or
            another. These "methods" can be collectively referred to as "coding", although there may be objections
            against this from those who insist on limiting the use of the term to quantitative research, and from those
            who attach importance to the political nature (authority)of research, for their own respective reasons.
            <br />
            This issue can be handled effectively by dividing it into two basic viewpoints: "what is the GTA?" and "what
            is the actual process of its analysis?" These viewpoints, which were previously introduced in order to
            mitigate the confusion and difficulty in understanding the GTA, can also be applied to understand other
            qualitative research approaches.<br />
            In actual cases, you put the actual name of the method instead of "GTA". For example, "what is
            ethnomethodology?" and "what is the actual process of its analysis?"; "what is the life story approach?" and
            "what is the actual process of its analysis?"; "what is the narrative approach?" and "what is the actual
            process of its analysis?; and the like.<br />
            Any qualitative approach involves some "methods" of different relative importance and explicitness. Paying
            attention to or extracting some specific part of the data, records or materials constitutes basic work for
            interpretation. Conventionally, qualitative research did not expend much effort with regard to "methods";
            however, recent years have seen many studies aiming at their clarification.<br />
            In this regard, it is important to pay attention, in a critical manner, to the balance and the degree of
            unification between "what is" a certain approach and "what is the actual process of its analysis?" Learners
            tend to focus their interest on the "methods" in an attempt to acquire knowledge and skills quickly, but
            there are more important things to understand before jumping on.</p>
          <p class="MG-B15">Now, when we look at the GTA, "what it is" was quite clear from the beginning. Great hope
            and support were placed behind this aspect of things. However, in terms of "what is the actual process of
            its analysis?", it was not readily comprehensible. <br />
            I skip the story behind this, which has already been explained (Kinoshita, 1999, 2003), but we have
            understood that the essential part of it lies in the technique of slicing of data. The confusion was found
            in seeing slicing the data as a technique without understanding its epistemological basis.<br />
            Speaking rather verbosely, this is the vagueness of both "What is the slicing of data?" and "How should we
            practice the slicing of data?", and of the relationship between them. This is the delicate balance between
            Glaser and Strauss which existed from the beginning.</p>
          <p class="MG-B15">As a result of examining all kinds of things, I came to think that we would not be able to
            sufficiently develop the possibilities of the original GTA if it were based on the technique of slicing the
            data, and this technique would, on the contrary, spoil its real possibilities. Speaking straightforwardly,
            the examination of "what and how" raised further viewpoints of "by whom and for what"; both of which
            concepts carry even greater significance. <br />
            This is because the former is defined by the latter. It is not possible to speak about the former alone
            without discussing the latter. This can be said about any research in general, not alone the GTA. It is
            rather paradoxical that researchers are preoccupied with doing research but they tend not to ask
            reflectively about themselves.<br />
            Processional researchers, be they in quantitative or qualitative research, tend to take things as
            postulated. And graduate students also tend to skip this part, as they have their own research tasks for
            thesis or dissertations; no doubt such being more urgent for them, they rush to interpreting the meaning of
            qualitative data without adequate preparation and training in thinking of themselves as researchers. And to
            make matters worse, they think that the technique of slicing the data assures objectivity. </p>
          <p>From this point, the M-GTA is constructed not to utilize the technique of slicing the data, but with the
            concept of the Researcher-At-Work (who conducts the research as a social activity, and for specific
            purpose).<br />
            Objectification of oneself as the "Researcher-At-Work" and conscious awareness of one's own concerns and
            issues to as great an extent possible were set as important factors. These are naturally required in doing
            any research, and, at the same time, they help in carrying out interpretation of qualitative data
            effectively.<br />
            This is because the researchers don't conceive of themselves as having an abstract existence as neutral
            scientists, but need to establish concrete questions based on significance and goals, and can verify their
            own standpoints as individuals in certain social contexts. Without relying on objectivity, analysis of
            qualitative data without arbitrary interpretation is certainly possible by drawing on and restructuring the
            way of thinking as presented in the M-GTA. </p>
          <p>The viewpoint of the Researcher-At-Work functions as a set with the Analytically-Focused Person. The
            Analytically-Focused Person is a collective other who is defined by research proposals, serving as a
            standard for the selection of interview subjects, providing a frame of reference when interpreting the data,
            and establishing the scope of the generalizability of the analysis results.<br />
            The M-GTA has three types of persons which are methodologically integrated; the Researcher-At-Work, the
            Analytically-Focused Person and actual persons in cooperating and applying, and they are defined in the 3
            phases of interactivity (Live Lecture M-GTA, Koubundou, 2007, pp.88-99). In other words, a researcher is
            "locked" into human relationships throughout the research process - data collection, analysis and practical
            application of the result - so that we observe research ethics and acquire generalizability in limited
            scope.</p>
          <p class="MG-B15">So if we decide not to slice the data, then this gives rise to the problem of how to handle
            the data. In order that the preconceptions of the analyzer do not enter into the picture, the method of
            slicing the data - where data is divided finely into sections and the meaning of each tranche is given
            consideration - begins with the process of fine slicing before the data is interpreted. This is cumbersome
            work, but logically it is necessary to begin with the work of finely slicing the data to the greatest extent
            possible.</p>
          <p class="MG-B15">If we decide not to use this method, then a certain new, innovative way of analysis needs to
            be developed. We ask ourselves what do we do about the very first point of contact with the data. This is a
            question we need. Subsequently the viewpoints of the Researcher-At-Work and the Analytical Theme are
            eventually introduced in the M-GTA.<br />
            As I have sought to emphasize at every opportunity, setting the Analytical Theme is an extremely important
            point, upon which the success or failure of the analysis depends. It is a research question carefully shaped
            and led by one's own interests. At the same time, the Analytical Theme is set in such a way that it
            facilitates exploration of varied content in the data.<br />
            This may look simple but is actually not so. It is better to spend the time to develop an Analytical Theme
            properly, rather than simply coming up with one off the top of your head. During that process guidance and
            advice are very important, helping you become conscious of what you intend to make clear. That way you look
            at the data from the standpoints of the Analytical Theme and the Analytically-Focused Person, and proceed to
            concept generation with the Analytical Worksheet.<br />
            In order to select specific parts of the data, the guidance viewpoint is necessary, and the M-GTA utilizes
            the Analytical Theme and the Analytically-Focused Person.<br />
            Conversely, slicing the data is not only a technique but also a methodology, which lets you bypass the
            conscious work of selection and interpretation of the data. You firstly segmentalize and then make a start
            with an investigation of the meaning of those segmented parts by making codes. Thus, this work has to be
            meticulous from the very beginning, and thereafter you proceed by making comparisons of codes generated.
            <br />
            Although sharing a constant comparative method to carry out analysis, the major difference between M-GTA and
            other types of GTA lies in the manner in how the initial comparative materials are chosen. The M-GTA
            emphasizes the contextuality in the data, which the act of slicing data destroys, and the self-reflectivity
            in interpretations of data, an essential element of the Researcher-At-Work.<br />
            And so even though at first glance it may look likeas if you are doing similar things, such superficial
            similarities in the work do not actually mean that the significance and purpose of the work are also
            similar.</p>
          <p class="MG-B15">In brief, it's best to be very precise during the initial analytical encounter with the
            data. Before dealing with the data, you should try to conceive of what it is you need to think about, what
            you are going to do, and why.</p>
          <p class="MG-B15">With the M-GTA, we look at the data from 2 aspects: the Analytical Theme and the
            Analytically-Focused Person. It cannot be overemphasized that concentration on these viewpoints is "must".
          </p>
          <p class="MG-B15">Due to an abundance of detail in the data, even being conscious of only these two points,
            many different ideas can come to the fore, inspired by the content. These can be carefully recorded in a
            "theoretical memo", but you need to concentrate foremost on the two points.<br />
            The reason why this approach works out is that even though you've narrowed things down to the two points,
            it's not the case that you can never make any changes just because you've made that decision. The Analytical
            Theme is conceived of before data gathering begins, and can be looked at again after data gathering is
            completed, and indeed can further be adjusted as necessary after data analysis has begun.<br />
            It's actually not unusual at the initial stage of analysis to examine the degree of fitness between the
            Analytical Theme and the data in general. It's not that you sift through the data with reference to the
            Analytical Theme and the Analytically-Focused Person, but that you make use of an adjustment method where
            you change the Analytical Theme as necessary so that the theme will be open to the specific variability of
            the data.</p>
          <p class="MG-B15">In contrast to the fact that a careful examination must be conducted until the Analytical
            Theme has been finalized, there is no way to go astray in setting the Analytically-Focused Person, as this
            is a group of people defined by research design, i.e. criteria for interviewees. This will involve
            adjustment in the form of increasing or decreasing the focus in connection with the Analytical Theme, i.e.
            adding conditions and broadening the scope of the subjects, or removing conditions and tightening the scope.
          </p>
          <p class="MG-B15">Interestingly, making this kind of adjustment with regard to the Analytical Theme and the
            Analytically-Focused Person, can allow you to set a second Analytical Theme leading to a second paper to
            publish.</p>
          <p class="MG-B15">It is recommendable to add the word "process" in an Analytical Theme such as "Research on
            the Process of". This is because an Analytical Theme ultimately attempts to capture a dynamic process. When
            using an Analytical Worksheet to generate concepts, you are always conscious of where and in what ways those
            concepts are likely to be related to the process being theorized as a grounded theory.<br />
            When analysis results look to be emerging quite quickly, then take it that your Analytical Theme has not
            been well enough thought out and look into it again. While the originality of your research is shaped by
            your results, it also actually has a strong connection with the Analytical Theme setting.<br />
            You might think this is all very tough, but the fact is that the more important something is, the less easy
            and less comfortably it is accomplished. There is no easy way. All research methods have a number of
            difficult aspects to master. However, steps do exist for overcoming them, and with the M-GTA the more
            carefully and reflectively you look into your Analytical Theme, the greater the extent to which you can
            assume an open approach when looking at your data.<br />
            This is because your attention will be drawn to various parts of the data. In the process of establishing
            your Analytical Theme, investigation will be added from many different points, and so you will make sure to
            be on the lookout for many things, and will be sensitive to content-richness of your data.<br />
            An open approach to your data does not simply entail having the right mental attitude, but is about making
            this kind of investigative work a part of you in an experiential sense.</p>
